# Roadmap

The purpose of this file is to give a high-level overview of planned features. The intent is to communicate the relative priority of these features. See this as a hopeful wishlist, rather than an exact timeline or promise, since it's difficult to predict how long some features may take to implement.

### Oct 2019
- [x] [Interactive editing mode](https://github.com/comby-tools/comby/pull/104), a la codemod.

### In the coming 3 to 6 months (Nov 2019 - Mar 2020)
- [ ] Optional holes [in progress](https://github.com/comby-tools/comby/pull/133)
- [ ] A more efficient rewrite of the parser engine (in progress)
- [ ] Matching support for arbitrary tagged delimiters, like HTML `<p>foo</p>`.
- [ ] Indentation-sensitive support.
- [ ] Official support for match rules that contain hole syntax. This needs planning to document and test the supported semantics.
- [ ] Official support for rewrite rules and semantics combined with match rules.
- [ ] Switching horizontal/vertical layout in comby.live.
- [ ] Tight matching
